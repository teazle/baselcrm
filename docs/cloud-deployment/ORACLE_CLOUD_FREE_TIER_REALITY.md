# Oracle Cloud Free Tier - The Reality

## ✅ Yes, There IS an "Always Free" Tier

Oracle Cloud offers **two types of free resources**:

### 1. **Free Trial** (30 days)
- $300 in credits
- Valid for 30 days
- Can use any region
- **Expires after 30 days**

### 2. **Always Free** (Never expires)
- Resources that are **free forever**
- **BUT** only in your **home region** (chosen at signup, cannot change)
- Limited resources
- **Subject to capacity availability**

---

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### **Home Region Requirement**
- You **must** choose Singapore as your home region when signing up
- **Cannot change** home region after signup
- Always Free resources **only work in home region**
- If you choose wrong region, you're stuck

### **Capacity Issues**
- Singapore region often has **"out of capacity"** errors
- Many users report being unable to create free VMs in Singapore
- You may need to:
  - Retry multiple times
  - Wait for capacity to free up
  - Try during off-peak hours
  - May never get capacity

### **Resource Limits**
The "24GB RAM, 4 cores" is **total across all instances**, not per instance:
- **Ampere A1**: Up to 4 cores total, 24GB RAM total
- You can split across multiple instances
- Or use all in one instance
- **But**: Subject to availability

### **What's Actually Free Forever**
- **Ampere A1**: Up to 4 cores, 24GB RAM (total)
- **AMD Micro**: 2 instances, 1/8 OCPU each, 1GB RAM each
- **Storage**: 200GB
- **Bandwidth**: 10TB egress/month
- **Networking**: Basic networking

### **What Costs Money**
- Resources outside home region
- Resources beyond free tier limits
- Some services (even in home region)
- Data transfer beyond 10TB/month
